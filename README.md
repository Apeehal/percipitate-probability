# percipitate-probability

This code models random spheres being placed in the lattice of a material to represent percipitates. It then calculates the probability of a slip plane parallel to the top of the cube intersecting the percipitate. 

You can change the radius of the percipitate by changing the "r" value. The code will generate between 0 and 10 percipitates.
